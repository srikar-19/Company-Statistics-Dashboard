# Getting Started with Create React App

#### Firstly, set your directory path correctly. i.e, to this current root folder path (dashboard)

In the project directory, you can run:

## -> For FRONT-END, run the following command :

     npm start


## -> For BACK-END, run the following command :

    node server.js


### -> The main project runs on url : http://localhost:3000/


# *** STEPS ***

## To run this project, Change the directory path from your default directory to this project's downloaded folder directory ( using cd) and then,

### Firstly you need to install Node.js and then following dependencies :

    -> npm modules
    -> @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
    -> @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
    -> @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
    -> body-parser
    -> bootstrap
    -> browserify-fs
    -> buffer
    -> cors
    -> express
    -> fs
    -> react
    -> react-bootstrap
    -> react-circular-progressbar
    -> react-dom
    -> react-hook-form
    -> react-redux
    -> react-router-dom
    -> react-scripts
    -> redux
    -> redux-persist
    -> stream-browserify


### So, to install above, We can use following corresponding commands :

    for node.js, just download and install node.js application to your local machine and then you can check the installation status :

        -> node -v
        -> npm -v

    and for remaining,

    -> npm install
    -> npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
    -> npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
    -> npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
    -> npm i body-parser
    -> npm i bootstrap
    -> npm i browserify-fs
    -> npm i buffer
    -> npm i cors
    -> npm i express
    -> npm i fs
    -> npm i react
    -> npm i react-bootstrap
    -> npm i react-circular-progressbar
    -> npm i react-dom
    -> npm i react-hook-form
    -> npm i react-redux
    -> npm i react-router-dom
    -> npm i react-scripts
    -> npm i redux
    -> npm i redux-persist
    -> npm i stream-browserify

**********************



### After running above two commands, it automatically redirects to the http://localhost:3000/


**********************

#### And now, run the project and you can do various operations on it by adding a widget or removing a widget.But to have a Dashboard Data information, I have a default information or a backup of this particular project which is a .json file and which contains the information like list of dashboard categories, widgets within the category & its id, name, content, status, description etc...

#### So that default backup dashboard data contains in the separate file which presents in root directory with a name "defaultData.json" file.

#### i.e, if in case you remove any default widget in the dashboard and if you want that widget or if you need the initial default dashboard data, You can just simply copy that entire dashboard data from that defaultData.json file and you can paste it into the main dashboardData.json file.

## Detailed information of the project and its purpose :

### * Project Name : Company Statistics Dashboard

### * Project Description : The Company Statistics Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive web application designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key company metrics and statistics. Built using React for the frontend and Redux for state management, the dashboard offers a highly customizable user experience, allowing users to add, remove, and search for widgets that display various data points and performance indicators.

#### The dashboard is divided into categories, each containing relevant widgets that provide visual insights into different aspects of the company's operations. Users can personalize their dashboard by selecting which widgets to display, making it a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing business performance in real time.

## * Key features of the Company Statistics Dashboard include:

### -> Search Functionality
### -> Widget Management ( add or remove widget)
### -> Selection or Unselection of specific widgets under that specific dashboard category
### -> Real-Time Data Integration

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
